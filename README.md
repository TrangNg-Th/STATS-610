# STATS 610 – Final Project  
**Simulation-based model selection for population biology**

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for STATS 610.  
The goal is to **replicate key results** from Toni et al. (2009), *“Simulation-based model selection for population biology”*, using an **ABC–SMC (Approximate Bayesian Computation – Sequential Monte Carlo)** framework applied to influenza household outbreak data.

All analysis, code, and write-up are contained in a single R Markdown document, which compiles to a PDF report.
